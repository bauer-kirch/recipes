  * Modify your DATABASE_URL config in <fg=green>.env</>

  * Configure the <fg=green>driver</> (postgresql) and
    <fg=green>server_version</> (15) in <fg=green>config/packages/doctrine.yaml</>

  * This recipe expects you to set up bounded contexts in src/, so no
    default "Entity" folder and default mapping have been created. After
    adding your bounded contexts, register ORM mappings in your
    <fg=green>config/packages/doctrine.yaml</> accordingly.
